If the customer forgets their pin then it can be reset using the ResetPin function. The customer must supply a birth date (or any other significant date) that matches the one that is registered. If a customer queries why a birth date is needed as part of the registration process then it is for this reason. Note: Though specified as a birth date any date of significance would be appropriate. There is no date range checking to check for age etc. The date is used to allow changes to the pin only.

This option automatically sets isActive = true, hence you can only request the creation of 1000 accounts in one request.
